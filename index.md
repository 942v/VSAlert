## Features

VSAlert is an iOS framework designed to replace UIAlertController. It was designed with the following principles in mind:

* No need to rewrite your code. VSAlertController behaves identically to UIAlertController. Create controller and add actions the same way you already do.
* Don't lose any functionality. VSAlertController supports everything UIAlertController does: action sheet and alert styles, UIAppearance, proper view controller lifecycle, and more.
* Better control over how your alerts look. VSAlertController adds custom animation styles, support for images, wider alert views, and more.

## About
* VSAlert is a packaged as a static iOS framework, written in Objective-C
* VSAlert is not depended on storyboards or XIBs to build it's UI.
* VSAlert is designed to be used with the latest SDK, but officially supports iOS 10.0+. It probably works with earlier releases, but I make no promises
* VSAlert is designed for use with iPhone and iPad devices.
